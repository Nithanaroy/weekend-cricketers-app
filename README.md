# Weekend Cricketers App

This is a companion app to view the results of voting that happens every week in the [Weekend Cricketers WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ik9K8tqRRCZK5shGQXlNfv). 
The app also presents some interesting stats around how many matches each player played in this Weekend Cricketers' League.

# How it looks

Check out some screenshots from the hosted app.
